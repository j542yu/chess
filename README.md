## Overview

Welcome to Chess! This is a command-line implementation of this classic game written in Ruby. It allows two players — human or AI — to play against each other, with support for saving game progress.

This game follows the standard rules of chess, which can be found here [here](https://www.instructables.com/Playing-Chess/). The ultimate objective is to checkmate your opponent’s king by putting it in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape.

> Note: This project was created as part of *The Odin Project*'s Ruby course in their Ruby on Rails path. The goal was to practice writing clean and modular code for a large project with no instruction given, while using Rspec to test crucial capabilities.

## Game Features

* ### Game Modes
    Upon running the game, a game mode can be selected:
    * **Human vs. Human:** Two players take turns playing on the same machine.
    * **Human vs. Computer:** The player plays against the computer, which selects random legal moves.

* ### Full Piece Movement Capabilities
    * **Standard Moves:** Every piece moves according to traditional chess rules.
    * **Special Moves** are supported, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

* ### Game Saving and Loading
    * Upon running the game, the player can **start a new game** or **load a saved game**.
    * After every move, the player can choose to **save the game progress** which can be loaded upon running the game again.

* ### Move and Check Validation
    * **Prevents Illegal Moves:** The game disallows any move that leaves the king in check.
    * **Checkmate Detection:** The game automatically ends when a player’s king is in checkmate and no escape is possible.
    > Note: The game does not support stalemate or resignation automatic endings, but the player is informed that `Ctrl-C` can be used to terminate the game at any moment.
